This is a powerful application that utilizes the OpenAI open API to convert videos into text transcriptions. With this tool, you can easily extract audio from a video, generate accurate transcriptions, and even create custom prompts to facilitate the creation of captivating descriptions and titles for your YouTube videos.

## Key Features

- **Video to MP3 Conversion**: We use the FFmpeg library to convert videos into MP3 format, reducing the load on the server.

- **Advanced Audio Transcription**: Through the OpenAI API, our application can generate precise transcriptions from video audio.

- **Custom Prompt Generation**: You can create custom prompts to feed into the AI and obtain unique descriptions and titles for your YouTube videos.

- **Intuitive User Interface**: The frontend is built with React and Vite and uses Shadcn to create modern and intuitive user interface components.

- **Robust Backend**: On the server side, we use Node.js and Fastify to ensure efficient performance and reliability.

- **Data Management with Prisma**: To store and retrieve data, we implement Prisma, a database ORM.
